##
Fate style Kingdom Building
Maybe stats similar to pathfinder (Though less giant numbers)
World map divided into zones which can be free or under control of a kingdom
Zones have aspects & features tied to them describing the region
Can be subdivided if more detail is needed
The kingdom has skills representing its stats and rolls with those -> Aspects within its borders can be invoked
Resources skill and stress representing taxes, expenditure, and debt
Option to just play the kingdom as a character, or the option to tie PC’s into it for kingmaker style gameplay
Building improvements -> creating aspects and improving skills?
Ability to run independently of a GM and with a GM
Can use scale against other notations and against PC’s
