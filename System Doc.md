Total effective refresh = Free Refresh + Stunts + Skill Points/4 + Total Weapon & Armor Rating/2
1 Refresh = 1 Stunt = 4 Skill Points = 2 Weapon/Armor Points

## Default Skill List
Skill cap is the total amount of refresh a player has spent on skill points.

| Acrobatics | Medicine | Performance | Slight of Hand  |           |

#### Physical Skills
Skills focused on a person's body, movement, and fitness, as well as physical conflicts

**Physique:** [Stress Track] Raw power and durability. Physique stunts let you perform superhuman feats of strength, throw your weight around while wrestling, and shrug off physical consequences.

**Fight:** Ability to excel at hand-to-hand combat, whether with weapons or fists. Fight stunts include signature weapons and special techniques.

**Shoot:** All forms of ranged combat, whether guns, throwing knives, or bow and arrow. Shoot stunts let you make called shots, quick-draw, or always have a gun handy.

**Stealth:** Staying unseen or unheard and escaping when you need to hide. Stealth stunts let you vanish in plain sight, blend into crowds, or advance through shadows unseen.

**Athletics:** A measurement of physical potential and feats of sportsmanship. Athletics stunts focus on movement—running, jumping, parkour—and dodging attacks

**Acrobatics:** Dexterous movement flying through the air or traveling over slim ledges. Acrobatics stunts might allow you scale impossible things or fit through impossible spaces.

#### Mental Skills
Skills focused on knowledge, understanding of the world, and the

**Will:** [Stress Track] Mental fortitude, the ability to overcome temptation, conduct rituals, prevent magical malfunctions of electronics, and to withstand trauma. Will stunts let you ignore mental consequences, withstand the mental agony of strange powers, and hold steady against enemies who provoke you.

**Lore:** Understanding and knowledge of tales and legends. Also covers history in games without a history skill

**Arcana:** Knowledge of magics and arcane weirdness

**Nature:** Knowledge of the natural/organic world

**Religion:** Understanding and practicing of religion

**Medicine:** Patching people up

#### Social Skills
Skills about communicating with, and manipulating others. Whether Rapport or Empathy is used for the social stress track will depend on campaign.

**Empathy:** [Stress Track] Ability to accurately judge someone’s mood and intentions. Empathy stunts can be about judging a crowd, picking up on lies, or helping others recover from mental consequences.

**Deceive:** Ability to lie and cheat convincingly and with aplomb. Deceive stunts might improve your ability to tell a particular breed of lie or help invent false identities

**Contacts:** Knowledge of the right people and connections that can help you. Contacts stunts give you ready allies and an information network wherever you go in the world

**Provoke:** Ability to push people to act the way you want them to, whether in conversation or combat. It’s coarse and manipulative, not a positive interaction. Provoke stunts let you push opponents into foolhardy action, draw aggression toward you, or scare enemies (assuming they can feel fear).

**Rapport:** [Stress Track] Building connections with others and working together. Where Provoke is manipulation, Rapport is sincerity, trust, and goodwill. Rapport stunts let you sway the crowd, improve relationships, or build contacts.

**Performance:** Performance is used to put on a show and entertain people for profit, pleasure, and distraction. Performance stunts may give you a bonus to certain styles of performing, or allow you to always have an instrument on hand.

#### Technical Skills
Skills and talents your average adventurer needs

**Burglary:** Knowledge of and ability to bypass security systems, steal anything and generally commit crimes. Burglary stunts give bonuses to the various stages of committing a crime, from the planning to the execution and escape

**Slight of Hand:** Magic tricking, pickpocketing, and lockpicking

**Notice:** Ability to pick up details in the moment, spot trouble before it happens, and generally be perceptive. It contrasts Investigate, which is for slow, deliberate observation. Notice stunts sharpen your senses, improve your reaction time, or make you harder to sneak up on.

**Investigate:** Deliberate, careful study and puzzling out mysteries. Use this to piece together clues or reconstruct a crime scene. Investigate stunts help you form brilliant deductions or piece together information more quickly.

**Animal Handling:** Training, care, and command of animals

**Survival:** Keep it together and under control under the stars, navigate in rough terrain, minor first aid. Stunts might give you bonuses in specific terrain or assist with the treatment of consequences.

#### Specialty Skills
Skills that are uncommon, take specialty training, or don't fit elsewhere

**Drive:** Controlling vehicles in unusual or extreme circumstances

**Crafts:** Ability to make or break machinery, build contraptions, and pull off MacGyver-esque feats of ingenuity. Crafts stunts let you have the gizmo on hand, give bonuses to building and breaking things, and provide justification for using Crafts in place of skills like Burglary under certain circumstances.

#### Alternative Skills
Skills for different styles or genres of campaigns

**History:** Knowledge of the past. Can be specialized with stunts. For games where this is a distinction between mythology and history

**Computers:** Advanced technological skills

**Engineering:** Design and construction. For games where crafts doesn't cover all item creation or career skills, or set in a more modern era

**Riding:** Control and riding of mounts. For games where animal handling or drive wouldn't be appropriate. (Like a game about running a stable and racing horses)

**Piloting/Boating:** Controlling space/air/water vehicles. Good for games where characters might come in contact with non-land vehicles frequently, or it makes sense for them not to be covered by drive

**Science:** Knowledge of the sciences. Can be specialized with stunts.

**Research:** Skill of conducting research. Overlaps a lot with investigation, but useful in some campaigns

**Language:** On a per language basis. +4 being a native speaker
Local Knowledge: 

**Adventuring:** Catch all for adventuring knowledge (experience with monsters, common solutions, historic dungeon layouts, etc.)

**Gaming:** Playing games of skill. Can be on a per game basis, and can represent video or traditional games

**Urban Living:** Like survival, but for urban environments

**Academics:** Covers the domain of history, the sciences, general research, and the depth of human knowledge. Good for games that need a distinction from lore, but not separated into separate skills.

**Long Haul:** Navigate the highways, drive motor vehicles, know which gas station food will poison you, find roadside way stations (motels, gas stations, rest stops, etc.), and figuring out the most likely route for someone to take. Stunts might give familiarity with specific regions or provide justification for using Long Haul in place of Contacts or Pilot. Good for roadtrip games

#### Monsterology
When players need to roll to figure out the non-human foe they're facing. Overlap is common between the skills

Lore - mythical monsters
Arcana - magical monsters
Nature - beasts and natural monsters

Low Fantasy roughly mimics the probability of 5e, High Fantasy is closer to something like pathfinder or Conan. People in a high fantasy setting are going to being doing nearly impossible tasks much more frequently and easily, but lower level task are slightly more difficult.

## Stress Management

Stress Tracks
Characters will have at least one of either a Physical (Physique), Mental (Will), Social (Rapport or Empathy) stress track, and up to all three, depending on the focus on physical, mental, and social conflict within the campaign.

| Skill      | [1] Boxes             | Scaling Boxes         | Varying Boxes     |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| +0 or Less | [1][1][1]             | [1][2]                | 3 Points          |
| +1 or +2   | [1][1][1][1]          | [1][2][3]             | 5 Points          |
| +3 or +4   | [1][1][1][1][1][1]    | [1][2][3][4]          | 8 Points          |
| +5 or +6   | Minor Consequence     | Minor Consequence     | Minor Consequence |
| +7 or +8   | [1][1][1][1][1][1][1] | [1][2][3][4][5]       | 11 Points         |
| +9 or +10  | 8 Boxes               | [1][2][3][4][5][6]    | 14 Points         |
| +11 or +12 | 10 Boxes              | [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] | 17 Points         |

**Varying Stress Boxes:** [Fate Codex Volume 3, pg 71] Instead of the normal range of box values from 1 up to 4, players take the total value of their boxes on each track and reorganize the points. For example, a character would normally have a 1, 2, 3, and 4 value stress box. That’s a total of 10, which the player could reorganize into many low value boxes - five 2-stress boxes, for instance - or consolidate to a couple high value boxes, like two 4-stress boxes and a 2-stress box

**Consequences and Conditions:** To start, characters have three consequence slots to absorb stress with on their character sheet: a (2) point minor consequence, a (4) point moderate consequence, and a (6) point severe consequence. Additionally, characters can choose to replace one of their existing character aspects as an (8) extreme consequence. They can gain additional consequence slots through skills.

Further, characters can buy into conditions as part of powers and abilities. Conditions function like consequences or stress tracks that only absorb stress in specific circumstances or spent as resources, while being tied to a specific aspect.

For urban or other appropriate settings, characters can take, and enemies can inflict collateral consequences.

**Collateral Consequences:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 61] In addition to their usual complement of consequences, the players can also make use of three communal consequences, one of each degree of severity. These represent damage to the environment or new complications in the story, such as Injured Bystanders or Anti-Mutant Hysteria. Players can effectively use them to offload harm from themselves onto the world around them. A collateral consequence can be cleared just like a regular one, using an overcome action with whatever skill seems most appropriate, with two exceptions. One, it must be done during the scene in which the consequence is incurred. Two, there’s no delay - with a good enough skill roll it clears immediately. This option is best suited for genres, such as supers, in which the PCs are likely to care a great deal about the world around them.

#### Healing & Recovery
The campaign has three main options for healing and recovery:
**Standard:** Normal Fate RPG recovery. Stress clears at the end of every scene. Consequences take a roll equal or greater to the value of the consequence (+2 if you're treating yourself) and time to recover. Upon succeeding on the roll to treat, rename the consequence to note its in recovery. Minor consequences clear an episode after treatment (can be in middle of an episode). Moderate consequences clear an arc after treatment. Sever consequences clear a season after treatment. Extreme consequences clear after completing a character goal.

**Step Down Stress:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 60] Stress goes away gradually rather than all at once. Instead of clearing a stress box automatically at the end of a scene, erase it and check the box to its left (assuming there is one). Consequences work normally.

**Tended Stress:** [Fate Codex Anthology Volume 3, pg 71] Stress only fades when narratively appropriate, when the characters have a chance to catch their breath and recover. Consequences work normally.

Step Down Stress and Tended Stress work well if their are alternative methods of recovery, such has health potions, medkits, or regenerative abilities.

## Gear, Loot, & Wealth

#### Gear
Characters are assumed to have their basic adventuring gear, such as normal weapons and armor, rope, extra ammo, etc., unless there is a narrative reason for the character not to have it on them. Players can spend a fate point to declare that they'd have an item when it'd be improbable, or create stunts or aspects that would allow them to claim that they'd be carrying it for a constant effect. If it is ever in doubt whether or not a character would have an item, have them roll an appropriate skill to determine if they do. This basic gear has no direct mechanical effect, though if lost, it can narratively prevent you from taking actions.

Beyond basic gear, characters can find or create advanced gear that provides bonuses, much like stunts, skills, and some extras. Advanced gear comes in two flavors, **Loot** and **Props**. Loot are permeant pieces of a character sheet, and cost refresh to create. Props are temporary pieces of gear that last anywhere from 1 scene to 1 arc, after which they either half to be bought with refresh or go away.

All advanced gear has a total effective refresh, and is marked like a character on a gear sheet. They have a **Name** (high concept) aspect that can be invoked or compelled like any other aspect. They can have skills, stunts, and free refresh to power stunts and invoke aspect tied to the gear (or not tied to the gear, if allowed by a stunt), which contribute to the items total effective refresh the same way they would a characters. Characters can use any of the abilities on piece of gear they hold has if they were their own, so long as they meet any requirements. If an item can be easily taken away from a character, reduce it's total effective refresh by 1. If an item is given a **Flaw** aspect, decrease its total effective refresh by 1. If an item is given additional permissions, defects, or costs, decrease its total effective refresh by a variable amount, as approved by the party.

**Props** are created with an appropriate skill roll (often, but not always crafts) with their difficulty being equal to their total refresh, and last for one scene until used upon a success. The length of time a prop lasts or the number of times a prop can be used is increased by one step for each shift above the difficulty. If the roll is succeed with style, the prop has unlimited uses, lasts the maximum amount, or gains an extra point of free refresh in addition to the normal bonus provided by extra shifts.

**Loot** is created without a skill roll, and costs the gears total effective free refresh to add to a characters sheet. Loot without out any decreases in cost function mostly as flavor. Loot with decreases in cost can function as a way to increase power with increased risk.

Both **Loot** and **Props** can be given out during adventures without incurring any cost to the character. GM's can give out props as powerful as they like, as long as they go away at the end of an arc, become a world feature, or are purchased as permeant by a player with their remaining free refresh. The loot given out by GM's can't have a total effective refresh greater than the major advancements earned by the party (Minimum 1).

**Vehicles:** Vehicle sheets don’t take any additional rules, instead functioning as a type of gear. The stunts a vehicle has are more likely to be focused on movement, but otherwise it has the same cost, equal to its total effective refresh.

**Weapon and Armor Ratings:** Sometimes weapons or armor are of a better quality then standard gear. This is represented by Weapon/Armor ratings. There two ways to handle weapon and armor ratings, depending on the tone of the game.

- **Deadly:** Appropriate for games where weapons are supposed to be very dangerous and armor rare and protective. A weapons rating adds to the shifts of stress on a successful hit. On a tie, the extra stress is inflicted rather than gaining a boost. Armor works similarly, reducing the amount stress damage equal to its rating. In the event armor reduces the shifts of stress a successful attack to 0 or less, the attacker gets a boost but deals no stress.

- **Level:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 70] Less lethal, but still matter in combat. Rather than adding shifts weapon ratings guarantee a minimum number of shifts to deal on a successful roll. If the roll exceeds this this, then the weapon rating is ignored. Armor ratings are the maximum amount of damage you can take in a single hit. Armor ratings always trump weapon ratings, unless the attacker succeeds with style, in which case armor is completely ignored. In this method, set a value to be the default rating for no armor (suggested Armor:5) which can be increased or decreased at a reward/cost of refresh when building a piece of gear.

#### Wealth
How much a characters specific wealth matters in any given campaign will vary depending on it's tone and setting. Below are several options:

- **None:** For settings where wealth and throwing money around doesn't matter, such as a bunch of gods partying on mt. Olympus, a heist game with flashback planning, or fulltime superheroes with unlimited funding, just ignore wealth. If a character wants it to be an important part of their character, they can take an aspect or a stunt to describe it.

- **Standard:** The standard for Fate Core. Characters have a **Resources** skill that represents their relative wealth. This functions like any normal skill, and comes into play when throwing money at a problem would be useful.

- **Carry-all:** Characters have a 2-point stress track ([1][1]) to track resources (food, money, duct tape, etc.) they're carrying. Resources can be expended to add bonuses on rolls where money or consumable supplies would make things easier, equal to the number of boxes you clear. You can increase the number of resources you carry through the use of stunts or by investing skill points (on a 1 to one basis). Some items you may come across will also be able to contain resources, effectively allowing you to carry more. As you gain resources, you will mark off a number boxes appropriate to the resources you receive. For example, if you work a few odd jobs you may be able to fill in [1], whereas if you find a large cache of minor magical items you may be able to fill in [1][1][1][1][1]. If you find more resources then you have boxes for, you either have to use them immediately, give them to someone who has space, or leave them behind.

Good for games where characters are constantly broke and trying to scrounge for resources.

- **Aspect Wealth:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 69] Similar to Carry-all, but uses aspects to expand the stress track, rather then items and skills. Start with a two [1][2] wealth stress boxes. These can be check for bonus on a roll where money or resources would be helpful. Characters gain additional wealth stress boxes for each aspect they have relating to their wealth up to 3 additional boxes. Wealth stress doesn’t go away on its own. Instead, you can only clear a checked box when you gain a parcel of wealth. Acquiring one lets you clear any number of stress boxes whose total values don’t exceed the parcel’s value. If you have one or more checked boxes of a value greater than that of the Wealth parcel you’ve received, do nothing to the boxes that exceed the parcel’s value. For example, if you acquire wealth:3, you can clear your first, second, or third stress box, if any one of them is checked, or both your first and second stress boxes—but not your fourth, if you’re lucky enough to have one.

- **Dynamic Resources Skill** [Strands of Fate 2e, pg 212]

	![[Dynamic Resources.png]]

Many of the wealth systems can also be abstracted to represent influence, in games where social currency is more important than money.


#### Negotiations
[Fate Codex Anthology Volume 2, pg 202] Negotiations are an additional mode of conflict focused on trade, deals, and resources.

![[Negotations.pdf]]

[Props originate in Return to the Stars by Festive Ninja](https://msabalau.itch.io/return-to-the-stars-rpg)

## Magic System Options
-5E Style
	Effective refresh allows for modular spells
	or a variant of borrowed power [Fate System Toolkit, pg 132]
-"Magic" Skill
-Add a caster aspect/stunt, then use regular skills depending on the magical task
-Channeling [Fate System Toolkit, pg 131]

Spells are roughly stunts. Spell level is equivalent to their effective refresh
Characters have a magic stress track. To cast a spell, a character has to take stress equal to the spell level. Upcasting is just requires taking more stress
Magic Stress is just stress, and is recovered at the end of the scene. Consequently stress tracks have less stress then a caster would be able to cast in a single day
To use magic, characters have to take an aspect describing their magic and its origin, and spend a refresh point to take “[magic type]-caster” Extra
Magic is either derived from a magic skill or from specific skills based on the source of magic? (Roughly: Bard=Lore/Performance, Wizard=Arcana, Cleric/Paladin=Religion, Druid/Ranger=Nature, Psionic/Sorcerer=Will, Warlock=Contacts, exceptions are always possible, if not common among PC’s)

Characters have a magic stress track. When casting spells, stress is taken - either based on  the power of the spell-stunt directly or the difference between a roll/skill value for the spell and the power of the spell-stunt (which can lead to more powerful characters not needing to spend stress for lower level spells) - unsure which. Normally stress steps down one box after every scene, except for pact-casters which gain them all back?

## World Creation & Exploration
Map
Zones
#### Features: Faces, Places and Organizations
Many types of features
Major and minor features?
Minor features are just an aspect where as major features have a full character sheet?
Are faces features, or are they a part of the feature?


**The Adventuring Party**
The adventuring party is almost a character in itself, holding a reputation, talents and core ideals. 
Describe the adventuring party, and the PC’s roll in it. From this description make a Party Concept and Party Trouble aspect, along with one or two blank aspect slots. The blank aspects will be developed during play. These are normal aspects that can be invoked or compelled. Any party aspect that is compelled places a fate point in a shared pool that is able to be used by any party members.
Pick one party skill rated at fair (+2), two skills rated at average (+1) and one stunt for the party. The party also has the reputation track extra
Players may use the parties skill or stunts rather than their own, in cases where the Party’s reputation would help them succeed in their task. Additionally, players may spend a fate point to use a party skills in addition to their own, additively. 
Adventuring Parties receive advancements as players do, and all members decide on what improvements to pick. If players are receiving advancements unevenly, choose either to have the advancements of the party match those of the player with the most advancements, or achieve advancements once the majority of party members have them. Any refresh gain this way contributes to the shared party pool at the beginning of the session
Additionally, Parties have an extreme consequence slot that any member can use to mitigate stress, describing how they pass the damage off on to the party, and irreparably change the bond between its members
Maybe give players the option to burn party skill and stunts for bonuses/stress soaking?

## Character Creation
Characters are a collection of aspects, flaws, stunts, skills, gear, and other features. They are built using a pool of starting refresh that can be turned basically any feature of the character.f the character.

#### Aspects
Aspects are a fundamental part of a character, describing them and their place in the narrative. Each character has several different ones:

**High Concept:**
**Trouble:**
**Motivation/Goal:**
**Relationship:**
**Other Aspect:**
**Other Aspect:**

Characters may gain temporary situational aspects, but otherwise are losely limited to these. Aspects have no refresh cost. 

#### Skills
Skills are the standard abilities characters are good at. When picking skills, refresh is traded for skill points at the cost of one refresh for 4 skill points. Any skill without points is rated at a +0. Each point spent on a skill is equal to a +1, so 3 points spent on a skill means a +3. The maximum number of points that can be spent on a skill is equal to the number of refresh spent on skills.

A standard fate core character spends around 5 refresh (20 skill points) on skills, and spreads that over 12 skills - one at +4, two at +3, three at +2, four at +1, to form a skill pyramid.

**[Optional] Skill Columns:** Players can be required to support their higher level skills with a column of lower level skills below, such that for each +4 skill a player has, they also have a +3 skill, +2 skill, and a +1 skill. This leads to more well rounded characters, particularly if using the skill pyramid.

**[Optional] Untrained Skills:** Characters who don’t have a skill points in a skill roll at a -1, rather than +0 representing their lack of training. This makes rolling skills outside of a characters depth much more punishing, which can be appropriate for some settings.

#### Stunts
Stunts are special abilities that a character has, helping them to do awesome things. Each stunt breaks the core rules in some way, giving a character a bonus they wouldn't have gotten in a special circumstances, allowing them to swap one skill for another in specific cases, or even creating a whole new action the character can take.


Can be used to do a variety of things
Generally a rules exception or a +2 in a specific situation
Auto succeed in specific situations
Declare a story detail for free
Can be used to swap stress track skills?
Can be used to specialize skills

Limits examples:
Once per session
Cost a fate point



**[Optional] Flaws:**

#### Stress & Consequences
Stress boxes and consequences are typically gained through skills, though feasible could be increased through stunts. Additional boxes or consequences aren’t directly bought with refresh.

**[Optional] Conditions:** Conditions are like specialized stress tracks and/or consequences slots that can only be activated in specific situations. This could be used to represent a barbarians rage or debts to a fae. Cost typically ranges from 1-3 refresh, depending on the potency of the condition, as agreed on by the players.

#### Gear
Characters can purchase loot to be a part of their character sheet. Loot costs the total effective refresh used to build it, minus any adjustments. Adding gear can be particularly useful for characterization, such as when playing a gadgeteer, or a character that would possess an item of significance that goes beyond their aspects.

#### [Optional] Allies, Companions, and Patrons
Allies, companions, and patrons are three different but similar things, each having coming to the aid of a character or the party at a specific cost.

**Companions** are the simplest, functioning as an extra character the player controls, tied either to a specific PC or occasionally a party organization. They have the same character sheet as the PC’s, expect that, they can’t have Companions, Allies, and Patrons of their own, and are limited to three aspects (**High Concept, Trouble/Goal, and Another Aspect**). Companions cost to their host PC refresh equal to the companions total effective refresh +1.

**Allies**

**Patrons**

#### [Optional] Reputation Track
PC’s, parties, and other major characters each have an extra called the reputation track, with entries for each region or local they’ve been to and made an impression on. Each entry has a fame/infamy skill, along with a reputation aspect that describe the character of their reputation. These can be interacted with like normal skills and aspects. At the end of a session, if the PC’s or party took major actions (or inaction) in a region the aspect can be updated. Increasing the fame/infamy skill and swapping out the reputation aspect can either be done at advancements or as a reward by the party at the end of Arc round-up

> [+2] **Slayer of The Velvet King**

The track can also be simplified to one general reputation, with the level of fame/infamy also describing how far and wide the character is known.

#### [Optional] Buy-In:
Players buy in with refresh?

## Advancement
GM's change at the end of a 1-4 session arc/episode, with most advancement occurring after that

Major advancements after completing a certain number of different difficulty quests/character achievements (Could be tide into goal aspects, complete a goal, defined by your aspect, get a major advancement. Maybe a couple of ways on top of that, defined by the group ahead of time?) 

PC's get normal advancement
BBEG get advancement based on beating PC's?
NPC's are static?

#### Timing
**Scene:** Most basic unit of campaign measurement. Each scene has a goal defined by the players and GM, and ends when that is fulfilled, failed, or shifts.

**Episodes:** Individual Sessions made up of 1 or more scenes

**Arcs:** Complete story or quest. Typically concludes when a GM finishes their adventure, and swaps out. Roughly 1-4 sessions

**Seasons:** A collection of arcs leading up to a major change in the world, such as a party member or BBEG dying/retiring, a feature on the world map being changed forever or a multi-arc/character goal being completed. Can also occur if the players feel things need to be shaken up

#### End of Arc Round-Up
