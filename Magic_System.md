##World Forge Magic Pitch

My basic idea is that there are two independent magic systems with different rarities in the world, and would work best in a generally low-magic setting. These two 
magic systems are split between a lost-language text based magic with more arcane vibes that is incredibly specialized information, and a ritual based magic system 
based on local traditions and most likely passed down by word of mouth.

For the text based magic system it is based around the idea that some ancient or lost civilization regularly used it as their writing system and has since been lost to
history. The meaning of words within the language is heavily dependent on what material words are written on, and what substance is used to write it. So for instance a
word might mean crease or fold when written on a piece of paper with ink, but might mean tear when written on paper in blood, but the same word painted on a rock may 
make it crack, carved might break, while written in blood it may shatter. How this works, is that the magic would work via invoking situational aspects alongside an 
stunt to justify the use of magic for varying materials, but for varying the substance used, out of a scene carving is available for a +2 just costing time, elsewise 
a user could take n physical stress to then get a +2n bonus to a roll for casting the magic to account for using blood for a stronger effect

For ritual based magic it is based around the idea of local superstition or women in the woods. It can do things like prevent a crop from being blighted, curing a 
headache, or unleashing an elder evil. It represents the small things that people would normally do like throwing salt over their shoulder to ward off evil spirits, 
while still accounting for things like an evil cult attempting to summon a dark god. Unlike the text based magic this requires no special stunt to utilize. Basically 
a player can spend a fate point to effectively declare a story detail that is a ritual. When they declare the ritual they can declare as many conditions to the ritual 
as they so desire, that must be adequately restricting (GM discretion), that each act as a situational aspect that can be freely invoked if those conditions are met. 
From that point on, that ritual is a world detail that can be attempted at any time, with those conditions having to be met.
