## Premise
* Rotating GM’s among players, switching after each 1-4ish session arc
* Each Player has 3-5 Characters: 1 PC in the party, 1 BBEG, and 1-3 Major NPC’s, and in most cases is responsible for roleplaying them when they come up
* World map starts blank, with players each adding a major feature to start off. GM’s and players can spend fate points during the game to add world details
* Westmarchs style exploration game, with the players deciding what they want to do and who they’re facing for each arc, with their choice at the start of an arc roughly determining the GM
* When a character is killed or retires they get replaced with a character that has a relationship to other characters in the campaign
* Fate-Based
* Fantasy Setting

## Design Goals
* Give the perpetual GM a regular chance to play
* Let people who enjoy world building for extended campaigns but not the focus to run them have a chance to do so
* Let people try out the dozens of character concepts them have

## Things To Talk About
* Consistent magic system
* Skills
* Number of Aspects
* Relationship Aspects
* Tropes that might need mechanics behind them ahead of time
* How tough in terms of consequences and stress should be
* Number of fate points
* Armor, weapons, and loot?

##  Preplanning
* How zones work in the world map
* How progression works for arc
* Stress and Consequence Rates
