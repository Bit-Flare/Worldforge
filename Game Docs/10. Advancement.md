## Advancement
Characters don't just remain static, but rather change and grow in response to the actions they take and world around them. There are three main types of advancement, **Upkeep**, **Milestones**, and **Breakthroughs**, in addition to an **End of Arc Roundup**.

#### Upkeep
**Upkeep** is the change that occurs in a moment of respite, focused on allowing characters adapt to their circumstances. Characters earn an Upkeep at the end of a session of play and gain the following benefits:

**Choose 1:**
- Swap the value of two skills on your sheet
- Replace one +1 skill on your sheet with a new skill
- Swap out an existing stunt
- Modify a single piece of gear without adding additional refresh
- Spend 1 point of refresh

**All of the Following:**
- Cash-out props

**Always:**
- Advance minor consequences by one stage - put minor consequences into recovery, or if in recovery clear them
- When appropriate, clear stress

**[Optional] Resting:** When using the optional resting rules, characters may receive an upkeep advancement after resting in place of receiving one at the end of the session.

#### Milestones
**Milestones** represent a break in the action where characters train and recover before they're next adventure. Characters earn a Milestone after then end of a GM's Arc, usually between 1-4 sessions, and gains the following benefits:

**All of the Following:**
- Benefits of an Upkeep
- Spend up to all free refresh
- Loot up to the loot limit
- Cash-out loot

**Always:**
- Advance moderate consequences by one step - put moderate consequences into recovery, or if in recovery clear them

#### Breakthroughs
**Breakthroughs** are the moments where characters step back to reflect on all they've achieved. Characters earn a Breakthrough at the end of the Arc in which they fulfill their Goal aspect. If approved by the table, the resolution of other character or world feature aspects can also be awarded a Breakthrough.

 **All of the Following:**
 - An additional point of refresh
 - All the benefits of a Milestone
 - The Addition of a World Feature

**Always:**
- Advance severe consequences by one step - put severe consequences into recovery, or if in recovery clear them
- Rename an extreme consequence

Each additional breakthrough earned by characters increases the the loot limit by one until the character leaves play.

#### End of Arc Roundup
At the end of every Arc, there is an **End of Arc Roundup** to help progress the world. Players should do the following as a group:

- Check characters for goal completion
- GM adds world feature
- Modify world features in response to the completed Arc based on table discussion

#### [Optional] Extra Advancements
There are a number of things players can do that might warrant an additional advancement, such as:
- Writing a session summary
- Maintain documentation for a world feature
- Excellent roleplaying

The group may decided to award additional advancements or other rewards during an End of Arc Roundup or Upkeep, based on the previous sessions

#### BBEG Advancement
- Two types of BBEG static & rival
- Rivals advance alongside the PC's until defeated
- Static BBEG's don't advance
- New BBEG's are on par with PC's

## Retirement
- Can be caused by death or choice
- Create world feature related to the retirement (Memorial statue, retried adventurer bar, giant rift in space time, etc.)
- Next character gets half the previous characters starting refresh (with min?)
- Looses bonus to loot limit but gets one piece of gear from the previous character with a value up to the number of breakthroughs they've had (min 1) -> powerful gear can also be temporarily nerfed if the character didn't have enough breakthroughs
- Relationship aspect of how this character new the previous (Kids, friends, enemy heel face turn after their rivals tragic death, etc.)
- NPC's can be promoted to PC, getting the difference in effective refresh?
