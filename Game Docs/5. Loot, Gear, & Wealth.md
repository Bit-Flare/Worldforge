## Gear, Loot, & Wealth

#### Gear
Characters are assumed to have their basic adventuring gear, such as normal weapons and armor, rope, extra ammo, etc., unless there is a narrative reason for the character not to have it on them. Players can spend a fate point to declare that they'd have an item when it'd be improbable, or create stunts or aspects that would allow them to claim that they'd be carrying it for a constant effect. If it is ever in doubt whether or not a character would have an item, have them roll an appropriate skill to determine if they do. This basic gear has no direct mechanical effect, though if lost, it can narratively prevent you from taking actions.

**Advanced Gear:** Beyond basic gear, characters can find or create advanced gear that provides bonuses, much like stunts, skills, and some extras. Advanced gear comes in two flavors, **Loot** and **Props**. Loot are permanent pieces of a character sheet, and cost refresh to create. Props are temporary pieces of gear that last anywhere from 1 scene to 1 arc, after which they either have to be bought with refresh or go away.

All advanced gear has a total effective refresh, and is marked like a character on a gear sheet. They have a **Name** (high concept) aspect that can be invoked or compelled like any other aspect. They can have skills, stunts, and free refresh to power stunts and invoke aspects tied to the gear (or not tied to the gear, if allowed by a stunt), which contribute to the items total effective refresh the same way they would a characters. Characters can use any of the abilities on piece of gear they hold has if they were their own, so long as they meet any requirements. If an item can be easily taken away from a character, reduce it's total effective refresh by 1. If an item is given a **Flaw** aspect, decrease its total effective refresh by 1. If an item is given additional permissions, defects, or costs, decrease its total effective refresh by a variable amount, as approved by the party.

*By default, the skills attached to a piece of gear are used in place of a characters skill, rather than adding on to them. Gear can spend a refresh to create a stunt or ability that allow the skills to be additive to the characters skill.*

**Props** are created with an appropriate skill roll (often, but not always crafts) with their difficulty being equal to their total refresh, and last for one scene until used upon a success. The length of time a prop lasts or the number of times a prop can be used is increased by one step for each shift above the difficulty. If the roll is succeed with style, the prop has unlimited uses, lasts the maximum amount, or gains an extra point of free refresh in addition to the normal bonus provided by extra shifts.

**Loot** is created without a skill roll, and costs the gears total effective free refresh to add to a characters sheet. Loot without out any decreases in cost function mostly as flavor, as the character could gain the same benefit by purchasing the abilities directly. Loot with decreases in cost can function as a way to increase power with increased risk.

Both **Loot** and **Props** can be given out during adventures without incurring any cost to the character. GM's can give out props as powerful as they like, as long as they go away at the end of an arc, become a world feature, or are purchased as permanent by a player with their remaining free refresh.

**Loot Limit:** The total effect refresh of all loot given out by GM's can't be greater than the total breakthroughs earned by current party members (Minimum 1) per Arc. As characters undergo character development, their capacity for power gain increases.

**Cash-Out** Allows players to trade their gear for wealth & influence when appropriate
Props -> Recover stress & Consequences
Loot -> Trade for refresh directly

**Vehicles:** If vehicles aren't an important part of the game, but a player wishes to have one, then they may be treated like a piece of loot created for the character under a vehicle theme. Under some circumstances a vehicle could be a prop, such as the party trying to hijack a getaway car. For games where vehicles are a major component of the setting more detailed rules are provided below:
- **Aspects:** Vehicles typically have three aspects, a **Make and Model** taking the place of it’s High Concept, describing what kind of vehicle it is and other key information, a **Manufacturing Defect**  taking the place of it’s Trouble indicating the major flaw in it’s construction, and an additional free aspect
-  By default vehicles only have a set of minor and moderate consequences, but can given stress tracks and expanded consequences through stunts if appropriate. Cars generally need repair if damaged, but a high-tech spaceship might have adaptive shielding. For games where fuel matters, all vehicles automatically get a fuel stress track using step-down or tended stress where appropriate.
- Vehicles can easily be tied into the carry-all wealth system through having it's own carrying capacity.
- Vehicles cost is determined by it’s total effective refresh, though if part of the conceit of setting, generally the characters won’t have to pay the cost, instead receiving it for free at an appropriate point in the campaign.

**Weapon and Armor Ratings:** Sometimes weapons or armor are of a better quality then standard gear. This is represented by Weapon/Armor ratings. There two ways to handle weapon and armor ratings, depending on the tone of the game.

- **Deadly:** Appropriate for games where weapons are supposed to be very dangerous and armor rare and protective. A weapons rating adds to the shifts of stress on a successful hit. On a tie, the extra stress is inflicted rather than gaining a boost. Armor works similarly, reducing the amount stress damage equal to its rating. In the event armor reduces the shifts of stress a successful attack to 0 or less, the attacker gets a boost but deals no stress.

- **Level:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 70] Less lethal, but still matters in combat. Rather than adding shifts, weapon ratings guarantee a minimum number of shifts to deal on a successful roll. If the roll exceeds this this, then the weapon rating is ignored. Armor ratings are the maximum amount of damage you can take in a single hit. Armor ratings always trump weapon ratings, unless the attacker succeeds with style, in which case armor is completely ignored. In this method, set a value to be the default rating for no armor (suggested Armor:5) which can be increased or decreased at as reward or cost of refresh when building a piece of gear.

#### Wealth
How much a characters specific wealth matters in any given campaign will vary depending on it's tone and setting. Below are several options:

- **None:** For settings where wealth and throwing money around doesn't matter, such as a bunch of gods partying on Mt. Olympus, a heist game with flashback planning, or full-time superheroes with unlimited funding, just ignore wealth. If a character wants it to be an important part of their character, they can take an aspect or a stunt to describe it.

- **Standard:** The standard for Fate Core. Characters have a **Resources** skill that represents their relative wealth. This functions like any normal skill, and comes into play when throwing money at a problem would be useful.

- **Carry-all:** Characters have a 2-point stress track ([1][1]) to track resources (food, money, duct tape, etc.) they're carrying. Resources can be expended to add bonuses on rolls where money or consumable supplies would make things easier, equal to the number of boxes you clear. You can increase the number of resources you carry through the use of stunts or by investing skill points (with a 2 skill points to 1 box trade). Some items you may come across will also be able to contain resources, effectively allowing you to carry more. As you gain resources, you will mark off a number boxes appropriate to the resources you receive. For example, if you work a few odd jobs you may be able to fill in [1], whereas if you find a large cache of minor magical items you may be able to fill in [1][1][1][1][1]. If you find more resources then you have boxes for, you either have to use them immediately, give them to someone who has space, or leave them behind. Good for games where characters are constantly broke and trying to scrounge for resources, or are far from places where they can resupply.

- **Aspect Wealth:** [Fate System Toolkit, pg 69] Similar to Carry-all, but uses aspects to expand the stress track, rather then items and skills. Start with a two [1][2] wealth stress boxes. These can be checked for bonus on a roll where money or resources would be helpful. Characters gain additional wealth stress boxes for each aspect they have relating to their wealth up to 3 additional boxes. Wealth stress doesn't go away on its own. Instead, you can only clear a checked box when you gain a parcel of wealth. Acquiring one lets you clear any number of stress boxes whose total values don’t exceed the parcel’s value. If you have one or more checked boxes of a value greater than that of the Wealth parcel you've received, do nothing to the boxes that exceed the parcel's value. For example, if you acquire wealth:3, you can clear your first, second, or third stress box, if any one of them is checked, or both your first and second stress boxes—but not your fourth, if you’re lucky enough to have one.

- **Dynamic Resources Skill** [Strands of Fate 2e, pg 212]

Many of the wealth systems can also be abstracted to represent influence, in games where social currency is more important than money.


#### Negotiations
[Fate Codex Anthology Volume 2, pg 202] Negotiations are an additional mode of conflict focused on trade, deals, and resources.
