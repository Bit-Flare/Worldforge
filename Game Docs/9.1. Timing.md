## Timing
**Scene:** Most basic unit of campaign measurement. Each scene has a goal defined by the players and GM, and ends when that is fulfilled, failed, or shifts.

**Episodes:** Individual Sessions made up of 1 or more scenes

**Arcs:** Complete story or quest. Typically concludes when a GM finishes their adventure, and swaps out. Roughly 1-4 sessions

**Seasons:** A collection of arcs leading up to a major change in the world, such as a party member or BBEG dying/retiring, a feature on the world map being changed forever or a multi-arc/character goal being completed. Can also occur if the players feel things need to be shaken up

**Campaign:** The some total of everything played in the game
